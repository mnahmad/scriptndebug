I was looking for simple way to document my work, so I can refer back to it and if possible help others as well.

I started a blog site back in 2014 using [wordpress](https://scriptndebug.wordpress.com/). Since I was not hosting the wordpress website, thus, had couple of difficulties like maintenance was always an issue. I wanted a simple solution where I don't have to compile like Jekyll etc.

Couple of weeks back, I started looking into github pages.  Finally, I found [this](https://kbroman.org/simple_site/pages/independent_site.html) solution which was all I need. Read more about it on [karl Broman](https://kbroman.org) website.
