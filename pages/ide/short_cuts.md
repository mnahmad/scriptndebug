I always struggle with remembering the IDEs shortcuts, thus, this blog/short documentation.


### VS Code

- Comment block of code

> Mac: cmd + /

and same to remove the comments form block

- Select multiple instances of same word 
	shift + cmd + L
### Atom

- Command Pallet:
For some packages, it is necessary to access command pallet, thus, use the following command

> Shift + Cmd + P

- Tab:
Add tab to code

Left tab
> Mac: cmd + ]

Right tab
> Mac: cmd + [


- Comments:
Comments block of code.

> Mac: cmd + /


- Regex:
Find space between 2 set of characters, first start search option (ctrl + f), then click the "Use Regex" [ .* ] on the status bar. Now you can use the following regex expression.

```
\b \b
```
where \b is word boundary, read more about Atom regex in this nice [documentation](http://2017.compciv.org/guide/topics/end-user-software/atom/how-to-use-regex-atom.html) and also see this [blog](https://dev.to/programliftoff/learn-regular-expressions-using-atom-alk)

- Browser Plus:
Open webpage in __Browser Plus__ (you need to install package [Browser Plus](https://atom.io/packages/browser-plus)). Following is the shortcut to open an html page in Browser Plus.

> ctrl + alt + o

- Project Manager:
Package __Project Manager__ is a nice tool to switch between projects quickly. Once install, you can access __Project Manger__ package by (a) opening "Packages" menu and click "Project Manager" or by using the following shortcut.

> Mac: cmd + p


 - Markdown blockquote
select text and press
1. CMD + Shift + L
2. Left arrow
3. Shit + >
