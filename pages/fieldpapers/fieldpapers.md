Field papers is an excellent tool for spatial field surveys. All you have to do is

1. Sign Up on http://fieldpapers.org/
2. Make an Atlas
3. If using satellite images, use Mapbox (if possible) as base layer. Issue with Bing maps is that some times it shows blackboxes on images (all the time in my case)

4. Print maps as field papers (with QR code etc)
5. Draw point, line and polygons with labels on paper
6. Scan (take photo will also work but scanning will give better results)
7. Upload field papers .jpeg (or other formats) to website
8. Now from here you can do two thing

+  Click iD and field paper website will take you to OSM web page. Login and you will see your scanned image as one of the layer on map. Start digitizing.

+ Click on download button and get a GeoTiff. Now use any GIS software to start digitizing, for example qGIS. [reference](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/192798/how-to-use-data-from-field-papers-to-qgis).   


Its pretty awesome :).
