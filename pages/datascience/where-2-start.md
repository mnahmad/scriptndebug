I started programming back in 1997 while in school, my first language was foxpro, moved to C (in second semester) and ended up programming in Visual Basic (started from version 5). Over the years learned php, Javascript, python and R. Python turned out to be my favorite language due to simplicity and it is part of my work (Django, data processing etc.). During data processing, I following some of the tutorials and videos, thus, thought it would be good share my learning path with others.

__Note__ This is a list of URL I following and not at all comprehensive list. All credit goes to the all the authors of these tutorials, posts and videos.

### Which python to use
You can use Official [Python](https://www.python.org/
), however for data science [anaconda python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is recommend, it has all the data science packages thus you don't have to install pakcages like numpy, Scipy, pandas, metaplotlib etc.   

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
This is a well discussed question, there are many suggestions like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Spider](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) etc. However, for data science, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and Anaconda Python is highly recommend, you can read more about jupyter at [this link](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook?utm_source=adwords_ppc&utm_campaignid=1455363063&utm_adgroupid=65083631748&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=b&utm_network=g&utm_adpostion=1t1&utm_creative=332602034364&utm_targetid=aud-299261629574:dsa-473406581035&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=9076848&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_LzB-MeQ4gIVCIXVCh1x1A-OEAAYASAAEgLETPD_BwE).

For beginners, I also suggest [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (if internet accessibility is not an issue) as, in my opinion, it is the fastest way to start coding and CoLab provides Jupyter Notebook as IDE.

You can read more abote IDEs at this [link](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-science-python-ide?utm_source=adwords_ppc&utm_campaignid=1455363063&utm_adgroupid=65083631748&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=b&utm_network=g&utm_adpostion=1t1&utm_creative=278443377092&utm_targetid=aud-299261629574:dsa-473406587035&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=9076848&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkN-Oo-2l4gIVkUPTCh3h6gN7EAAYASAAEgJ99PD_BwE).

### Where to start
The best tutorial website I found is [tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/). I suggest any one learning python could start form this website.   

I highly recommend that you complete all topic on this website.

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Python 2.7 End of Life (EOL) is on 1st January 2020, [reference](https://www.anaconda.com/end-of-life-eol-for-python-2-7-is-coming-are-you-ready/), thus, beginners better start from Python 3.

There are many OOP tutorials for python 3, however, I followed this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM&amp=&feature=youtu.be&amp=&fbclid=IwAR1adWPPtb_wIVn9v8qr_fyNC4lBYD3xtu0kWYA6FGefpsK_zfWrdS9Sfgg) series. Its short but explains all the necessary bits and pieces.  



#### Some essential topics

##### dictionary
An other topic one should master is python dictionary, although it is cover in the tutorial above, however, I followed the this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daefaLgNkw0).  

##### Regular expression
During data processing, some time one needs to search big files for certain string patterns or load files with different names from single/multiple folders. Like return all the /lines starting from "A", have number and ends with "Z" like "A2Z" or "Y2Z" OR load all files that are a certain string patten in their name. Regular expression is the solution, thus, have a look at this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQlKPdKVXfw&amp=&index=11&amp=&fbclid=IwAR256F4TxtMmIR7_YfvdqZDtUFTsl3vXZatXrm9XYG4R_sFE2CRfiMY4-CE) and this [amazing post](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285)


#### Some essential libraries
__numpy__

After basic tutorial, I also read [this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/practical-numpy-understanding-python-library-through-its-functions-adf2e3841894).

[this link](https://medium.com/fintechexplained/why-should-we-use-numpy-c14a4fb03ee9)

__Pandas__

 If you have not work with pandas before, it is the right time. Have a look at [this excellent post](https://medium.com/kitepython/pandas-tutorial-da4dd84edd00)

__Plotly__

[this link](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-next-level-of-data-visualization-in-python-dd6e99039d5e)

__metaplotlib__


__seaborn__

Build on metaplotlib

### GIS specific
For GIS developers, also see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuJ_JUkahXQ) and [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvHXRuGPHl0).

From time to time, I also go and watch some lectures on [this Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLqEr-xV-ceHdXXXrTId5ig/videos).

Excellent course by [UC Boulder](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics-python/) and [University of Findland](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/CSC18/?fbclid=IwAR2_S_li66u98FKWeXPIk78k0yFqJhhg4fLTwiSYu10NjqgeArk4BgaWGOQ), the last one is a must for GIS python developers.

### Statistics
Before jumping into data science topics, its good to Statistics as you will be using a lot of techniques in data science.

For this, I took help from [this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-tutorial-short-stop-to-introduce-main-statistical-concepts-8213724550f4) and also saw some of the concepts on [this website](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-tutorial-short-stop-to-introduce-main-statistical-concepts-8213724550f4).

Also read [this post](https://medium.com/@Saslow/simulating-probability-events-in-python-5dd29e34e381) for probability analysis.


Also read [this post](https://medium.com/diogo-menezes-borges/introduction-to-statistics-for-data-science-16a188a400ca).

Finally, I also take help from [this link]((https://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/))

### Data Science
Its all about data processing, to learn the trends and insights out of data. But before we can start data analysis, we need to learn data cleaning. Its rare that you will find clean analysis ready data. data cleaning is the first tasks of data science.
[this link](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-data-cleaning-and-preprocessing-2070b7d4c6d)

A good start is to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTxyviU0Ddo) about data science, In the video description you will see link to [github book](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/8a34a4f653bdbdc01415a94dc20d4e9b97438965/notebooks/Index.ipynb) by Jake VanderPlas. Its an excellent book.   


#### what is exploratory data analysis
Second,  learn about your data, what it contains like columns, number of rows, basic patterns etc. I saw this [exploratory data analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-8fc1cb20fd15) and it is excellent.
