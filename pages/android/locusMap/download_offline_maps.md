[LocusMap Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=menion.android.locus&hl=en) is an excellent android app for navigation. Not only it is free but also allows users to

1. Download offline maps for navigation
2. Add Point of Interest (POI)
3. Load already generated POIs.

I will talk about point 1 in this blog and will cover 2 and 3 in future blogs. There are couple of ways you can download offline maps in LocusMap Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=menion.android.locus&hl=en), so lets look at some of them.

### Using cache to download maps

(actually map tiles)

### Offline maps provided by LocusMap  

__Note__ You need to register with LocusMap server to use this option.  

### Download offline OSM map
