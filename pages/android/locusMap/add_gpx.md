As you might have read in the previous blog, I like using [LocusMap Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=menion.android.locus&hl=en) as it provides an opportunity to download free offline maps. When ever I am traveling I download these offline maps the route or destination. As mentioned in previous blog, LocusMap Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=menion.android.locus&hl=en) allows users to create or load Point of Interest (POIs) and navigate to these POIs.  




### Add Point of Interest (POIs).
