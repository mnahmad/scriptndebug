Script&debug is all about my daily experience and interaction with different languages, libraries, frameworks and software. I work with python, php, Javascript, gdal, OpenLayers, Extjs, GeoExt, jQuery, Mapfish, Django, PostgreSQL, mySQL, QGIS, GeoServer, R etc.

- [Common CLI Commands](pages/commands.html)
- [Field Papers](pages/fieldpapers/fieldpapers.html)
- [Band combination for Landsat and Sentinel 2](pages/satellite/band_combination.html)
- [Download Landsat Images by using Python script](pages/satellite/Landsat/download_landsat57.html)
- [OziExplorerCE](pages/androzic/androzic.html)
- [Bitnami and mySQL](pages/containers/mysql_bitnami.html)
